# LITune SIGMOD 2025 Setup and Evaluation Guide


This is the code repo for Paper **A New Paradigm in Tuning Learned Indexes: A Reinforcement Learning-Enhanced Approach**

Track Name: Round 4 Paper Submissions

Paper ID: 1129

You can check some supplemental info here: [Supplemental Materials](./supplemental_materials/README.md)


## 1. Prerequisites:
* Ensure you have `g++` installed with support for `C++17` and the required flags.
* Python environment set up, preferably using a virtual environment for isolation.

## 2. Dependicies on External Learned Index Repo

> ALEX: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/microsoft/ALEX)

> CARMI: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/JiaoyiZhang/CARMI), [Research Paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.14778/3551793.3551823)


## 3. Running Environment:

Firstly, make sure you have the required C++ compile environment set up. It should support both ALEX and PGM use cases (Just apply LITune on ALEX as an example). Run the following commands for compilation:

```
g++ ./Index/Alex/index_test.cpp -w -std=c++17 -msse4 -mpopcnt -mlzcnt -mbmi -o ./Index/Alex/exe_alex_index
./Index/Alex/exe_alex_index ./data_SOSD/{data_file_name} {query_type}
```

Here we provided the dafault sample data chunks stored in `data_SOSD` folder from SOSD OSM (For SOSD, see here `https://github.com/learnedsystems/SOSD`). We also prepared four datasets in total: *books*, *fb*, *OSM*, *MIX*. Others are stored in `./data_SOSD_other`

For Python dependencies, you can use `pip` to install the required libraries:

- Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```
python3 -m venv litune_venv
source litune_venv/bin/activate
```

- Install the Python requirements:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 4. Evaluation:

For a more extensive list of options and flexible configurations/arguments, delve into the Python controller files located in the ./scripts directory or check the provided shell execution scripts.

### Evaluation Pointers:
> - Note: Please be cautious when using CARMI for certain use cases, as it may exhaust system memory and potentially cause system instability or crashes. Always ensure you have adequate backups and monitor resource usage during evaluations.
> - Here, we just take ALEX as an example, please use the similar command for testing on CARMI
> - Output evalutation results to `./logs`
> - For all evaluations, repeat with `query_type` as `read-heavy` and `write-heavy` as mentioned
> - Sample queries and workloads can be found in `./Index/Alex/index_test.cpp` or `./Index/CARMI/index_test.cpp`
> - For the RL-based tuner, the default configuration utilizes the Vanilla DDPG model. If you wish to experiment with the Context DDPG model, which incorporates an LSTM-based context module, you can modify the arguments in the shell scripts accordingly. This adjustment will enable the use of a more sophisticated model that integrates historical contexts of safe explorations into its decision-making process.


**Pre-training LITune-RL**:

> You have two options available:

> - You can train the model from scratch using the provided scripts.
> - For a quicker approach, you can directly proceed to the evaluations section by utilizing the pre-trained model located in `./rlmodels`.


- Pre-training the RL model for ALEX:

```
sh exe_RL_training.sh
```

**Static Experiments**:


- Step 1: Run the evaluation for different budgets and output results:

```
sh eval_single_budget.sh balanced ALEX | tee ./logs/single_budget_balanced.txt
```

- Step 2: Run evaluations with rich budget:


```
sh exe.sh balanced ALEX | tee ./logs/full_budget_balanced.txt
```

**Data Shifts**:

- Step 1: Run the evaluations without the O2 system:

```
sh exe_stream.sh balanced ALEX | tee ./logs/stream_balanced.txt
```

- Step 2: Run the evaluations with the O2 system:

```
sh exe_O2.sh | tee ./logs/stream_balanced_O2.txt
```
